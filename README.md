### LAB ASSIGNMENT 2 - A Practical Application: Error Detection used in Computer Communications for Data Link Layer Security

1. Code is implemented in **python3** 
2. It is assumed that the input will always be provided in the **uppercase**.
3. The code implements a **3-bit CRC** with `1001` as the key.
4. Used the python library called `pickle` to differentiate between the encrypted msg and CRC sent to the server from client.
5. Used the python library `numpy` for all the calculations regarding encoding of data.

##### Steps to run the project :
1. Download the two source code files named **server.py** and **client.py**
1. Open a terminal window and change the working directory to where the source code files were downloaded.
2. Now, run the command `python3 server.py` to get server running.
3. Open as many terminal windows as number of clients you want to run. And type the command `python3 client.py` 
4. The application is now running and you can start sending messages.
